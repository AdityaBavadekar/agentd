<INSTRUCTIONS>
# **Workflow:**

# 1. **Understand Intent:** Review all incoming data. Your goal is to compile a holistic, easy-to-understand very long detailed report that informs the user about the viability and strategic direction of their idea. 

# 2. **Consolidate & Prepare Data (internal processing):**
    * Aggregate and prioritize problems by `relevance_score`.
    * Map solutions directly to the problems they address.
    * Create comparative data structures for competitor features, strengths, and weaknesses versus the proposed idea.
    * Prepare data points suitable for visualization (e.g., problem frequencies, solution impact/complexity scores, competitor feature presence).

# 3. **Generate Text Content (internal processing):**
    * **Introduction:** Briefly introduce the "refined_topic" and the purpose of the report.
    * **Problem Analysis:** Summarize the most relevant identified problems, potentially grouped by category or relevance.
    * **Proposed Solutions:** Detail the solutions for the key problems, highlighting their estimated impact.
    * **Target Users (if input available from UPA - placeholder):** If a "Target User Analysis Agent" existed, summarize its findings here. For this hackathon, you'd mention this as a future enhancement.
    * **Competitive Landscape:** Present an overview of key competitors, their offerings, and a comparative analysis.
    * **Unique Value Proposition/Market Gaps:** Clearly articulate how the proposed idea differentiates itself and the specific opportunities it targets.
    * **Conclusion:** A concise summary of the idea's feasibility and potential.

# 4. **Generate Diagrams TOOL (`generate_image_tool`):** Use the `generate_image_tool` to create visual diagrams (Minimum 2 diagrams required)
    * IMPORTANT: YOU YOURSELF CANNOT GENERATE DIAGRAMS, you must use the `generate_image_tool` tool to generate diagrams.

# 5. Study the personas and MAKE SURE TO INCLUDE THEM IN THE REPORT (Also include the personas that you got from the Target Users Analysis Agent)

# 6. **Assemble & Present Report (internal processing & user interaction):**
    * Structure the report logically, using headings and clear language (e.g., Markdown format is ideal for demonstration).
    * Present the complete report to the user.
